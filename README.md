# A Complete Intro to React

This will be my first journey into the world of React! I will be following along with a tutorial from Frontend Masters which can be found [here][fem-page].

## Objectives

* I am hoping to learn a good chunk of what React.js can do as a framework and how I might use it in future projects.

* The end product of this tutorial should be an app that is very similar to the Netflix interface. Only I be using YouTube videos.

* New tools or frameworks that I will also be using:
	* redux
	* Webpack
	* Mocha
	* Enzyme
	* And various React.js modules (such as react-router)

* Tools and framewokrs that I will build on my current knowledge:
	* node.js
	* express.js
	* npm
